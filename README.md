<h1>What is this?</h1>
A WPF application for creating, configuring, and running quiz question packs.
This project serves as the third and final assignment in the C# course at IT-Högskolan, focusing on applying concepts such as MVVM, asynchronous operations, structured UI development, and clean application architecture.

<h1>The application includes:</h1>

In <b>Configuration Mode</b>, users can create, edit, and organize entire question packs, adjusting everything from individual questions to overall pack settings.
When switching to <b>Play Mode</b>, the app runs full quiz sessions with shuffled questions and answer options, built-in timers, and clear feedback after each answer.
<br>
The project also includes dedicated dialogs for editing pack options or creating brand-new question packs. 
<br>All data is handled through asynchronous JSON storage, ensuring that question packs can be saved and loaded without blocking the interface
